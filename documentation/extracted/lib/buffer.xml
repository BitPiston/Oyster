<document title="Output Buffering Functions">
    <synopsis>
        These functions that allow capturing output.  These were inspired by
        php's ob_* series of functions.
    </synopsis>
    <todo>
        Rename to ob_?  There is more than one kind of buffer.
    </todo>
    <section title="Implementation Details">
        This actually only uses one buffer, but allows for multiple buffers
        by keeping a stack of the length of that buffer each time a new one
        is started.
