    <synopsis>
        Functions that allow errors to be handled and trapped.
    </synopsis>
    <todo>
        Handle modules that throw stringifiable objects (use Error;)
    </todo>
    <todo>
        FIXME! If an exception is thrown from a catch block, it should NOT be thrown from the same level it was caught, but one below
    </todo>
    <todo>
        Catch blocks should probably assume abort()
    </todo>
    <function name="throw">
        <synopsis>
            Throws an exception to be caught by a catch handler.
        </synopsis>
        <note>
            The perl here is can be pretty tough to understand, it is heavily
            documented!
        </note>
        <note>
            "=&gt;" is just syntactic sugar, you can use "," too.
        </note>
        <note>
            Handlers are executed in the scope of where the exception was thrown
            from, this is a byproduct of how the exception system works (handlers
            can choose to abort or not)
        </note>
        <note>
            Exceptions thrown from inside handlers are treated as if the exception
            was thrown from the same scope that the original exception came from.
        </note>
        <prototype>
            throw(string exception_type[ =&gt; arguments to be passed to exception handler])
        </prototype>
        <example>
            throw('validation_error', 'Title is too short') if length($INPUT{'title'}) &lt; 5;
        </example>
        <example>
            throw 'validation_error' =&gt; 'Title is too short' if length $INPUT{'title'} &lt; 5;
        </example>
    </function>
    <function name="catch">
        <synopsis>
            Executes a block of code, trapping exceptions.  Returns true if the block
            executed successfully without exceptions, false otherwise.
        </synopsis>
        <note>
            If an exception of an unknown type is encountered, it is rethrown as a
            perl_error.
        </note>
        <note>
            Exceptions *must* be caught!  An uncaught exception raises a perl_error.
        </note>
        <note>
            If multiple catch blocks are defined for the same exception type, the
            innermost takes precedence.
        </note>
        <note>
            If an exception is caught further up the stack than it was thrown, the
            handler can either abort at the level it was caught at or the level it
            was thrown at.  See abort() for more information.
        </note>
        <prototype>
            bool success = try { block } [ catch string exception_type, with { block } ... ];
        </prototype>
        <example>
        try {
            print "Hello";
                throw 'error' =&gt; 'something went terribly wrong' if $armageddon;
                print " World\n";
            }
        </example>
        <example>
            catch 'error', with {
               my $msg = shift;
               print "Error: $msg\n";
               abort();
            };
        </example>
    </function>
    <function name="abort">
        <synopsis>
            Ends execution of a try block.
        </synopsis>
        <note>
            Calling abort() with no arguments will end all blocks up to where the
            error was caught.
        </note>
        <note>
            Calling abort(1) ends only the most recent try block, regardless of
            where the error was caught.
        </note>
        <note>
            If no try blocks are active, returns false and does nothing.
        </note>
        <note>
            If called outside of a catch block, this will always act as abort(1).
        </note>
