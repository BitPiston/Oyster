    <function name="process_args">
        <synopsis>
            Quick and dirty command line argument processing.  This treats any string prefixed with - or -- as a 'key' and any string directly after it as a value for that key.  If no key is available, the value is stored with the key ''.
        </synopsis>
        <note>
            If you include config.pl (or it was included for you), you do not need to call this, the results will be stored in %oyster::config::args.
